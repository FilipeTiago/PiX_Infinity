Those scripts depend on the HidHide software to hide gamming devices when streaming games with sunshine.
You only require those scripts if when starting a game with moonlight the game detects other gaming devices and does not use your "console" joypad.

Before using the scripts, open HidHide configuration tool and mark all gamming devices, leave "Enable device hiding" unchecked, the scripts use this tool CLI to enable/disable cloaking.

On sunshine, change the command to use the script Start-Game.cmd <steam game id>, on the post commands End-Game.cmd.
